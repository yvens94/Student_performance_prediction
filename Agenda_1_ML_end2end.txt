Agenda 1 08/26/2022

1- Set up the GitHub repository
	a)new environment
	b) mini project stucture    setup.py
	c) requirements.txt


________________________NEW EBVIRONMENT_______________________________________
First Create a folder where we would 

Go to github create new repositories

open Anaconca prompt: in our case it was not working we solve it installing anaconda for windows again without desintalling 
the previous version

go to the folder and cppy the path
in the anaconda prompt move to the path using cd and the path

once in the path write the command: 'code .'  to connect to vs code


in VScode we open a terminal can be shell or cmd and we create an environment with the command
conda create -p (name of the environment venv in our case) the python version  can find this using the command python --version in cmd
and -y to give the persmission

conda create -p venv python==3.10.9 -y 

cls to clean the terminal

Conda activate environment name/    ; to activate the terminal



----------------------SYNC WITH GIT-----------------------------------------------------------

git init in the env to create repsitories but didn't work 
git wasn't installed
the path was not set correctly
try to set it in the environement variable settings but it was more simple to reinstall and enable allow use cmd and 3rd party command line

with git working in the cmd, out of vs we had to reinitialize vs to get git to work

follow the git guidelines
git init to start the library
git commit
git add
git push
etc...
create new file in .gitignore choose python as the language
comiit changes
git pull to view the changes in the vs code

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created  2 more files
setup.py and requirements.txt
in the setup.py put the folliwn
from setuptools import find_packages, setup

setup(
name ='mlproject',
version= '0.0.1',
author= 'Yvens'
author_email= 'ayvenjee@gmail.com',
packages= find_packages(),
install_requires =['pandas', 'numpy', 'seaborn']

)

created the source folder and a file __init__.py
